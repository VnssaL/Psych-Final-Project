The pain is due to discharge of jellyfish nematocysts and associated toxins and discharge can be caused by a variety of mechanical and chemical stimuli. A series, Wahlgren, C.-F., Rifkin, J.

The research presented intended to determine the chemicals that stimulate or inhibit nematocyst (stinging cells) discharge and whether or not they brought relief to testers who were exposed to the sting of jellyfish tentacles. A total of 8 chemicals were tested. This was done by stinging one of the authors and using the solutions on the injury with a day healing period. One arm was not treated while the other was for comparison. The research concluded that acetic acid, ethanol, ammonia and bromelain (meat tenderizer) contributed to immediate discharge of nematocysts. Lidocaine concluded to provide pain relief. The experiment included confounds of skin sensitivity, meaning the pain recorded can range for each person. The forearms also belong to the authors so there may be experimenter bias present. Because it was done over a 20 day period and no combinations of each solution, it did not present internal validity. I hypothesize that chemical compounds of vinegar react with nematocysts to activate them, causing increased pain sensations.

The research presented intends to study the combined effects of temperature and salinity on ephyra and polyp production. The researchers hypothesized that salinity and temperature would have a large impact on the asexual reproduction of the jellyfish. The experimenters compared the jellyfish in captivity being studied to sampling from jellies in their natural environment. It was concluded that ephyra and polyp production were low at salinities of 5, 30 and 35% and ephyra production increased with more food availability. Since all the species were taken from one location it proves no external validity. I hypothesize that light conditions can trigger strobilation in sea nettles, based on the proposed idea by the authors that changing light conditions would do that.
