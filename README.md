The pain is due to discharge of jellyfish nematocysts and associated toxins and discharge can be caused by a variety of mechanical and chemical stimuli. A series, Wahlgren, C.-F., Rifkin, J.

The research presented intended to determine the chemicals that stimulate or inhibit nematocyst (stinging cells) discharge and whether or not they brought relief to testers who were exposed to the sting of jellyfish tentacles. A total of 8 chemicals were tested. This was done by stinging one of the authors and using the solutions on the injury with a day healing period. One arm was not treated while the other was for comparison. The research concluded that acetic acid, ethanol, ammonia and bromelain (meat tenderizer) contributed to immediate discharge of nematocysts. Lidocaine concluded to provide pain relief. The experiment included confounds of skin sensitivity, meaning the pain recorded can range for each person. The forearms also belong to the authors so there may be experimenter bias present. Because it was done over a 20 day period and no combinations of each solution, it did not present internal validity. I hypothesize that chemical compounds of vinegar react with nematocysts to activate them, causing increased pain sensations.

Temperature, salinity and food effects on asexual reproduction and abundance of the scyphozoan Chrysaora quinquecirrha (sea nettle jellyfish)

The research presented intends to study the combined effects of temperature and salinity on ephyra and polyp production. The researchers hypothesized that salinity and temperature would have a large impact on the asexual reproduction of the jellyfish. The experimenters compared the jellyfish in captivity being studied to sampling from jellies in their natural environment. It was concluded that ephyra and polyp production were low at salinities of 5, 30 and 35% and ephyra production increased with more food availability. Since all the species were taken from one location it proves no external validity. I hypothesize that light conditions can trigger strobilation in sea nettles, based on the proposed idea by the authors that changing light conditions would do that.

The research presented intends to calculate predation rates on prey populations because it is believed that the Chrysaora quinecirrha (sea nettle jellyfish) are extremely important to the plankton dynamics of a bay area, as well as control the copepod populations. Overall the relationships between copepod density, medusa diameter and water temperature was tested The experiment included taking sample medusa’s and emptying their stomach of copepods through feeding them other prey and diameters recorded. While in captivity, copepod exoskeletons were examined to determine digestion rates. The study concluded that the sea nettle showed positive selection for only copepods and selected against bivalve veligers. Diet habitats depended on the bell diameter of the medusa. The study may have overestimated because the mean sizes collected for gut content were not average sizes for the general population, disproving external validity. Dates of the experiment were not included either, which could affect the predation rates, disproving internal validity. I hypothesize the size of the medusae affects the rate of predation as well as prey consumed.

The research presented intended to determine the relationship between swimming motions and prey encounter with capture surfaces. It’s thought that the bell shape, swimming motion and particle velocities are related. Medusa were collected for the experiment and video taped to map out swimming motions. Prey was dyed with fluorescein to trace the water motions around the swimming medusa. The bell diameter ranges from 0.8 to 8.0 cm in this sample as well as collected from two different sites. It was concluded that captures of prey were near the bell region and was in relevance to the jellyfish’s pulsation cycle in swimming. There were no observed differences in bell diameter and swimming velocity. The only critique I have is there was no information on particle movements in accordance with the bell diameter. Based on this research, I hypothesize the bell pulsation cycle does not rely on the diameter of the medusa.

The research presented intended to understand the C. quinquecirrha medusa presence and abundance and how this species could potentially affect the energy flow in Chesapeake Bay. Lastly it aims to be able to predict blooms of this species in the future. It is proposed that the salinity and temperature of the water determines the distribution of the sea nettle jelly. The experiment included two habitat models, one predicting the likelihood of medusae occurring and the other predicting the potential concentration. According to sight counts of the species as well as tested water temperatures and salinity levels in the bay,  the models could be applied to a distribution map. The medusa were randomly selected as well as the dataset of their absence and presence. There was little internal validity in this experiment because it was mainly based on predictions, a capture and release method might do better to understand the living habits of these jellyfish. Based on the research, I hypothesize seasonal factors affect sea nettle distribution.
