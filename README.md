Evaluation of the effects of various chemicals on discharge of and pain caused by jellyfish nematocysts
Author links open overlay panelLaura M. Birsa, AbstractJellyfish tentacles in contact with human skin can produce pain swelling and redness. The pain is due to discharge of jellyfish nematocysts and associated toxins and discharge can be caused by a variety of mechanical and chemical stimuli. A series, Wahlgren, C.-F., Rifkin, J. F., Ramasamy, S., Burnett, J. W., Auerbach, P. S., Binshtok, A. M., & Cheng, D. (2010, January 29).

The research presented intended to determine the chemicals that stimulate or inhibit nematocyst (stinging cells) discharge and whether or not they brought relief to testers who were exposed to the sting of jellyfish tentacles. A total of 8 chemicals were tested. This was done by stinging one of the authors and using the solutions on the injury with a day healing period. One arm was not treated while the other was for comparison. The research concluded that acetic acid, ethanol, ammonia and bromelain (meat tenderizer) contributed to immediate discharge of nematocysts. Lidocaine concluded to provide pain relief. The experiment included confounds of skin sensitivity, meaning the pain recorded can range for each person. The forearms also belong to the authors so there may be experimenter bias present. Because it was done over a 20 day period and no combinations of each solution, it did not present internal validity. I hypothesize that chemical compounds of vinegar react with nematocysts to activate them, causing increased pain sensations.
